Towards 3D hybride solver

3. Change both to Matlab fftn functions
4. Change left and righ to those of uniform grid and reproduce result from K2D solver
4a. Check solution 2D with MIT example
5. 3D:
	a. Change transforms to 2D and add one more eigenvalue
        b. apply the method from Succi program to X and solve the resulting with the the solver.
	c. Try both ones from backward
